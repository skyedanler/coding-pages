<h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
<p>Code surrounds us. It's in the technology we use and of course, all the websites we browse. Since I began
    my journey in the world of programming, my brain has certainly rewired itself to think about how things are influenced
    by code or could be written as such, from the video games I play to the patterns I knit as ridiculous that sounds. 
    The 'Inspect' feature on my browser has become a reliable companion in seeing how other developers think 
    and what could benefit me. 
</p>
<p>My name is Skye Danler and I'm a mathematics graduate from the University of Southern Maine. 
    I have various passions not limited to knitting/crocheting, reading, writing, cooking, baking, 
    and of course, <strong>CODE</strong>! I'm especially passionate about loving life.
    For that reason, I'm starting a journey in coding because not only do I think that I am and will
    be extremely good at it, I also think that it would benefit me to have a future in something where I can constantly solve problems.
    So, dear reader, I introduce you to my page where I will take you on my programming journey through words
    and code.
