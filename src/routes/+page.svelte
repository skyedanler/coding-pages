<h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
<p>Code surrounds us. It's in the technology we use, the websites we browse. Since I really started to
    get serious about my journey in the world of programming, I've noticed the code in everything. Not only
    do I use the 'Inspect' feature on my browser way more often to see how other developers make their sites work
    and what could benefit me, but I've also thought about what the code would be for certain things.  
</p>
<p>My name is Skye Danler and I'm a mathematics graduate from the University of Southern Maine. 
    I have various passions not limited to knitting/crocheting, reading, writing, cooking, baking, 
    and of course, <strong>CODE</strong>! I'm especially passionate about loving life.
    For that reason, I'm starting a journey in coding because not only do I think that I am and will
    be extremely good at it, I also think that it would benefit me to have a future in something where I can constantly solve problems.
    So, dear reader, I introduce you to my page where I will take you on my programming journey through words
    and code.
