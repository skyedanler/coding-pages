<h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
<p>My name is Skye Danler and I'm a mathematics graduate from the University of Southern Maine. 
    I love to knit/crochet, read/write, cook/bake, and of course, <strong>CODE</strong>! 
    I feel like I'm a pretty versatile person but I'm especially passionate about loving life.
    For that reason, I'm starting a journey in coding because not only do I think that I am and will
    be extremely good at it (this girl is a fast learner and a hard worker), I think that 
    it would benefit me to have a future in something where I can constantly solve problems.
    So, dear reader, I introduce you to my page where I will take you on my journey through words
    and code.
